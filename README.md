# Modular nets

This is a library to create neural networks in an easy modular way using numpy.
I'm developing this in parallel of following the CS231N course of Stanford 
University of 2017, [link to the course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).

The point of this library is for me to check my knowledge and eventually use it 
in some projects later.
The code is inspired of the assignment 2.
I will put a link to the course page when I use citations of the course in the 
documentation.
