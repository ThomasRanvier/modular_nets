# Modular conv nets

This is a library to create neural networks in an easy modular way using numpy.
I develop this in parallel of following the CS231N course of Stanford University
of 2017, [http://cs231n.stanford.edu/](link to the course).

The point of this library is for me to check my knowledge and eventually use it 
in some projects later.
The code is inspired of the assignment 2.
I will put a link to the course page when I use citations of the course in the 
documentation.
